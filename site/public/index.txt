Syntax Highlighting, Reinvented O(n) guaranteed. Zero ReDoS. Thread-safe by design. Rosettes is a pure-Python syntax highlighter built for the free-threaded era. Every lexer is a hand-written state machine—no regex backtracking, no exponential blowup, no security vulnerabilities. from rosettes import highlight html = highlight(&quot;def hello(): print(&#x27;world&#x27;)&quot;, &quot;python&quot;) Why Rosettes? O(n) Guaranteed Every lexer processes input in linear time. No regex patterns that can be exploited for denial-of-service attacks. Code 55 Languages Hand-written state machines for Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, and 51 more languages. Full syntax support, not just keywords. Cpu Free-Threading Ready Optimized for Python 3.14t (PEP 703). True parallelism with highlight_many() for multi-core systems. Palette Pygments Compatible Drop-in CSS class compatibility. Use your existing Pygments themes or Rosettes' semantic classes. Quick Example from rosettes import highlight, highlight_many # Single block html = highlight(&quot;const x = 1;&quot;, &quot;javascript&quot;) # Parallel processing (optimal for 8+ blocks) blocks = [ (&quot;def foo(): pass&quot;, &quot;python&quot;), (&quot;fn main() {}&quot;, &quot;rust&quot;), (&quot;let x = 1;&quot;, &quot;javascript&quot;), ] results = highlight_many(blocks) # 1.5-2x speedup on 3.14t Performance Benchmarked against Pygments on a 10,000-line Python file: Operation Rosettes Pygments Speedup Tokenize 12ms 45ms 3.75x Highlight 18ms 52ms 2.89x Parallel (8 blocks) 22ms 48ms 2.18x
