About Rosettes Rosettes is a modern syntax highlighter designed for Python 3.14's free-threading era. Every design decision prioritizes safety, predictability, and performance. Core Principles Principle Meaning O(n) guaranteed Linear time complexity, no exponential blowup Zero ReDoS No regex patterns that can be exploited Thread-safe by design Immutable state, no global mutable data Pygments compatible Drop-in CSS class compatibility Why Rosettes? Traditional syntax highlighters use regular expressions, which can exhibit exponential worst-case behavior (ReDoS). A carefully crafted input can freeze your application for minutes or hours. Rosettes eliminates this risk entirely by using hand-written state machine lexers. Every lexer processes input character-by-character with single-character lookahead, guaranteeing O(n) time complexity.

Tags: architecture, design

Architecture Rosettes uses hand-written state machine lexers instead of regular expressions. This design guarantees O(n) time complexity and eliminates ReDoS vulnerabilities. State Machine Lexers Every lexer is a finite state machine that processes input character-by-character: ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ State Machine Lexer │ │ │ │ ┌─────────┐ char ┌─────────┐ char ┌─────────┐ │ │ │ INITIAL │ ────────► │ STRING │ ────────► │ ESCAPE │ │ │ │ STATE │ │ STATE │ │ STATE │ │ │ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ emit │ emit │ emit │ │ ▼ ▼ ▼ │ │ [Token] [Token] [Token] │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ Key Properties Property Guarantee Single-character lookahead O(n) time complexity No backtracking No ReDoS possible Immutable state Thread-safe Local variables only No shared mutable state How It Works 1. Character-by-Character Processing The lexer reads one character at a time, deciding what to do based on the current state and the character: def tokenize(self, code: str) -&gt; Iterator[Token]: state = State.INITIAL pos = 0 while pos &lt; len(code): char = code[pos] if state == State.INITIAL: if char == &#x27;&quot;&#x27;: state = State.STRING start = pos elif char.isdigit(): state = State.NUMBER start = pos # ... more transitions elif state == State.STRING: if char == &#x27;\\&#x27;: state = State.ESCAPE elif char == &#x27;&quot;&#x27;: yield Token(TokenType.STRING, code[start:pos+1]) state = State.INITIAL pos += 1 2. No Backtracking Unlike regex engines that may backtrack on failed matches, state machines make irrevocable decisions: Regex: a+b on &quot;aaac&quot; Tries: a, aa, aaa, then backtracks to try fewer a's State Machine: Reads 'a' → accumulate Reads 'a' → accumulate Reads 'a' → accumulate Reads 'c' → emit NAME token, continue No backtracking needed 3. Predictable Performance Because each character is processed exactly once, time complexity is always O(n): Input Size Time (State Machine) Time (Regex worst case) 100 chars 0.01ms 0.01ms 1,000 chars 0.1ms 0.1ms 10,000 chars 1ms 1-10ms 100,000 chars 10ms 10ms - ∞ (ReDoS) Lexer Structure Each lexer follows the same pattern: class PythonLexer: name = &quot;python&quot; aliases = (&quot;py&quot;, &quot;python3&quot;) def tokenize(self, code: str, start: int = 0, end: int | None = None) -&gt; Iterator[Token]: # State machine implementation ... def tokenize_fast(self, code: str, start: int = 0, end: int | None = None) -&gt; Iterator[Token]: # Optimized path without line tracking ... Two Tokenization Paths Method Use Case Features tokenize() Line highlighting, analysis Full line/column tracking tokenize_fast() Maximum performance No line tracking The highlight() function automatically chooses the appropriate path based on options. Registry Lexers are registered with their canonical name and aliases: # Internal registry structure LEXERS = { &quot;python&quot;: PythonLexer, &quot;py&quot;: PythonLexer, # alias &quot;python3&quot;: PythonLexer, # alias &quot;javascript&quot;: JavaScriptLexer, &quot;js&quot;: JavaScriptLexer, # alias # ... } The registry uses functools.cache for thread-safe memoization: @functools.cache def get_lexer(name: str) -&gt; Lexer: lexer_class = LEXERS.get(name.lower()) if lexer_class is None: raise LookupError(f&quot;Unknown language: {name}&quot;) return lexer_class() Adding a New Lexer To add a new language lexer: Create lexers/mylang_sm.py with a state machine class Register in lexers/__init__.py Add tests in tests/lexers/test_mylang.py Example minimal lexer: from rosettes._types import Token, TokenType class MyLangLexer: name = &quot;mylang&quot; aliases = (&quot;ml&quot;,) def tokenize(self, code: str, start: int = 0, end: int | None = None) -&gt; Iterator[Token]: if end is None: end = len(code) pos = start line = 1 col = 1 while pos &lt; end: char = code[pos] # State machine logic here yield Token(TokenType.TEXT, char, line, col) pos += 1 col += 1 def tokenize_fast(self, code: str, start: int = 0, end: int | None = None) -&gt; Iterator[Token]: # Same as tokenize but without line/col tracking yield from self.tokenize(code, start, end) Next Steps Thread Safety — How thread safety is achieved Performance — Benchmarks and optimization

FAQ General What is Rosettes? Rosettes is a pure-Python syntax highlighter designed for Python 3.14t's free-threading era. It uses hand-written state machine lexers instead of regex, guaranteeing O(n) performance and eliminating ReDoS vulnerabilities. Why &quot;Rosettes&quot;? Rosettes are the distinctive rose-shaped spots on a Bengal cat's coat. This library was extracted from the Bengal static site generator, maintaining the feline naming theme. What Python versions are supported? Python 3.14 and later. Rosettes is designed for modern Python with free-threading support (PEP 703). Languages How many languages are supported? 55 languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Go, C, C++, Java, Ruby, PHP, and more. Why not 500+ languages like Pygments? Quality over quantity. Each Rosettes lexer is a hand-written state machine optimized for performance and correctness. Adding a language requires careful implementation, not just regex patterns. Can I request a new language? Yes! Open an issue on GitHub. Popular languages are prioritized. Does Rosettes support automatic language detection? No. Rosettes requires explicit language specification. For auto-detection, use filename extensions or a separate library like pygments.lexers.guess_lexer(). Performance How much faster is Rosettes than Pygments? 2-4x faster for typical code blocks: Operation Speedup Tokenize 3.75x Highlight 2.89x Parallel (8 blocks) 2.18x What is ReDoS and why should I care? ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) occurs when a regex pattern exhibits exponential backtracking on certain inputs. A crafted string can freeze your application for hours. Rosettes is immune to ReDoS because it doesn't use regex for lexing. When should I use highlight_many()? For 8 or more code blocks. The thread pool overhead makes it slower for small batches. Styling Can I use my existing Pygments themes? Yes! Use css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;: html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) What's the difference between semantic and Pygments classes? Style Example Class Readable Semantic .syntax-keyword ✅ Yes Pygments .k ❌ Cryptic Semantic classes are self-documenting. Pygments classes are compatible with existing themes. Integration Does Rosettes work with Sphinx? Not directly. Sphinx uses Pygments. You'd need to build a Sphinx extension to use Rosettes. Does Rosettes work with Jupyter? Not directly. Jupyter uses Pygments for syntax highlighting. Custom configuration would be needed. Does Rosettes work with Bengal? Yes! Bengal uses Rosettes for all syntax highlighting. Thread Safety Is Rosettes thread-safe? Yes. All public APIs are thread-safe: Tokens are immutable NamedTuples Lexers use only local variables Registry uses functools.cache Does Rosettes work with Python 3.14t free-threading? Yes. Rosettes declares itself safe for free-threading via _Py_mod_gil (PEP 703). The highlight_many() function provides true parallelism on 3.14t. Troubleshooting LookupError: Unknown language The language name or alias isn't recognized: from rosettes import supports_language, list_languages # Check if language is supported supports_language(&quot;python&quot;) # True supports_language(&quot;cobol&quot;) # False # List all supported languages print(list_languages()) Output looks wrong Check you're using the correct language Verify your CSS includes the appropriate classes Check for conflicting CSS rules Performance is slower than expected Use highlight_many() for multiple blocks Avoid show_linenos=True and hl_lines unless needed Profile with cProfile to identify bottlenecks Contributing How do I add a new language? Create lexers/mylang_sm.py with a state machine lexer Register in lexers/__init__.py Add tests in tests/lexers/test_mylang.py Submit a pull request How do I report a bug? Open an issue on GitHub with: Python version Rosettes version Minimal reproducing code Expected vs actual output

Performance Rosettes is designed for predictable, high performance. State machine lexers provide O(n) time complexity with no worst-case surprises. Benchmarks vs Pygments Tested on a 10,000-line Python file: Operation Rosettes Pygments Speedup Tokenize 12ms 45ms 3.75x Highlight 18ms 52ms 2.89x Parallel (8 blocks) 22ms 48ms 2.18x Benchmarked on Apple M1 Pro, Python 3.14 Time Complexity O(n) Guaranteed Rosettes processes each character exactly once: Input Size Time 1,000 chars ~0.1ms 10,000 chars ~1ms 100,000 chars ~10ms 1,000,000 chars ~100ms Linear scaling—no exponential blowup. Comparison with Regex Regex-based highlighters can exhibit catastrophic backtracking: Pattern: (a+)+$ Input: &quot;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&quot; Regex: Exponential time (2^n attempts) Rosettes: Linear time (n character reads) Memory Usage Rosettes uses minimal memory: Component Memory Lexer instance ~1 KB Token 80 bytes 10,000 tokens ~800 KB Tokens are NamedTuples—lightweight and cache-friendly. Optimization Tips Use highlight_many() for Multiple Blocks For 8+ code blocks, parallel processing is faster: # Slow: sequential results = [highlight(code, lang) for code, lang in blocks] # Fast: parallel (for 8+ blocks) results = highlight_many(blocks) Blocks Sequential Parallel Speedup 4 10ms 12ms 0.83x (overhead) 8 20ms 15ms 1.33x 50 125ms 70ms 1.79x 100 250ms 130ms 1.92x Skip Line Features When Not Needed Line numbers and line highlighting use the slower code path: # Fast path (no line features) html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;) # Slow path (line features enabled) html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, show_linenos=True) html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, hl_lines={1, 2, 3}) The difference is ~15% for typical code blocks. Reuse Lexer Instances Lexers are cached automatically: from rosettes import get_lexer # Same instance returned (cached) lexer1 = get_lexer(&quot;python&quot;) lexer2 = get_lexer(&quot;python&quot;) assert lexer1 is lexer2 # True No need to manually cache lexers. Parallel Scaling GIL Python (3.13 and earlier) With the GIL, parallel highlighting provides limited benefit: Workers Speedup 1 1.0x 2 1.1x 4 1.15x 8 1.2x The GIL prevents true parallelism, but I/O overlapping provides some benefit. Free-Threading (3.14t) With free-threading enabled, true parallelism is achieved: Workers Speedup 1 1.0x 2 1.8x 4 3.2x 8 4.5x Near-linear scaling up to 4 workers, then diminishing returns due to memory bandwidth. Profiling Profile your highlighting with cProfile: import cProfile from rosettes import highlight code = open(&quot;large_file.py&quot;).read() cProfile.run(&#x27;highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;)&#x27;, sort=&quot;cumtime&quot;) Or use timeit for quick benchmarks: import timeit from rosettes import highlight code = &quot;def foo(): pass\n&quot; * 10000 time = timeit.timeit( lambda: highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;), number=100, ) print(f&quot;Average: {time/100*1000:.2f}ms&quot;) Comparison Table Feature Rosettes Pygments Time complexity O(n) O(n) typical, O(2^n) worst ReDoS vulnerable No Yes (some lexers) Parallel support Native Manual only Free-threading Optimized Not tested Memory per token 80 bytes ~200 bytes Dependencies None None Next Steps Comparison — Detailed Rosettes vs Pygments comparison Parallel Processing — Using highlight_many()

## Page 8/141: Thread Safety

URL: /docs/about/thread-safety/
Section: about
Tags: threading, safety

Thread Safety Rosettes is thread-safe by design, with explicit support for Python 3.14t's free-threading mode (PEP 703). Thread-Safe Guarantees All public APIs are safe for concurrent use: Component Thread Safety Mechanism highlight() Uses only local variables tokenize() Uses only local variables highlight_many() Thread pool with isolated workers Token Immutable NamedTuple get_lexer() functools.cache memoization How It Works 1. Immutable Tokens The Token type is a NamedTuple, which is immutable: class Token(NamedTuple): type: TokenType value: str line: int = 1 column: int = 1 Tokens cannot be modified after creation, eliminating data races. 2. Local-Only Lexer State Lexers use only local variables during tokenization: def tokenize(self, code: str) -&gt; Iterator[Token]: # All state is local state = State.INITIAL pos = 0 buffer = [] while pos &lt; len(code): # Process character ... No instance variables or global state are modified during tokenization. 3. Cached Registry The lexer registry uses functools.cache: @functools.cache def get_lexer(name: str) -&gt; Lexer: return LEXERS[name.lower()]() This provides thread-safe memoization—the same lexer instance is returned for the same name across all threads. 4. Immutable Configuration All configuration classes are frozen dataclasses: @dataclass(frozen=True) class FormatConfig: css_class: str = &quot;rosettes&quot; data_language: str = &quot;&quot; Free-Threading Support (PEP 703) Rosettes declares itself safe for free-threaded Python via the _Py_mod_gil attribute: def __getattr__(name: str) -&gt; object: if name == &quot;_Py_mod_gil&quot;: return 0 # Py_MOD_GIL_NOT_USED raise AttributeError(f&quot;module &#x27;rosettes&#x27; has no attribute {name!r}&quot;) This tells Python 3.14t that Rosettes: Does not require the GIL Can run with true parallelism Is safe for concurrent access without locks Concurrent Usage Patterns Safe: Multiple Threads Highlighting from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor from rosettes import highlight def highlight_page(content: str) -&gt; str: # Extract and highlight all code blocks return highlight(content, &quot;python&quot;) with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor: pages = [&quot;code1&quot;, &quot;code2&quot;, &quot;code3&quot;, &quot;code4&quot;] results = list(executor.map(highlight_page, pages)) Safe: Shared Lexer Instance from rosettes import get_lexer # Same instance returned (cached) lexer = get_lexer(&quot;python&quot;) # Safe to use from multiple threads def process(code: str) -&gt; list: return list(lexer.tokenize(code)) Safe: highlight_many() from rosettes import highlight_many # Designed for parallel execution blocks = [(code, lang) for code, lang in code_blocks] results = highlight_many(blocks) # Thread pool internally What NOT to Do Don't: Modify Tokens # Tokens are immutable - this fails token = Token(TokenType.KEYWORD, &quot;def&quot;) token.value = &quot;class&quot; # ❌ AttributeError Don't: Rely on Global State # Don&#x27;t do this - Rosettes has no global mutable state import rosettes rosettes.SOME_SETTING = True # ❌ No effect, not supported Performance on 3.14t On Python 3.14t with free-threading enabled, highlight_many() provides true parallelism: Scenario GIL Python Free-Threading Speedup 10 blocks 15ms 12ms 1.25x 50 blocks 75ms 42ms 1.78x 100 blocks 150ms 78ms 1.92x The speedup comes from true parallel execution without GIL contention. Verifying Free-Threading Check if you're running free-threaded Python: import sys if hasattr(sys, &quot;_is_gil_enabled&quot;): if sys._is_gil_enabled(): print(&quot;GIL is enabled&quot;) else: print(&quot;Free-threading active!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Python &lt; 3.13 (always has GIL)&quot;) Next Steps Parallel Processing — Using highlight_many() Performance — Benchmarks and optimization

Highlighting Rosettes provides two core functions: highlight() for HTML output and tokenize() for raw tokens. Overview Function Purpose Returns highlight() Generate HTML with syntax highlighting str (HTML) tokenize() Get raw tokens for custom processing list[Token] highlight_many() Parallel highlighting for multiple blocks list[str] tokenize_many() Parallel tokenization list[list[Token]] Quick Example from rosettes import highlight, tokenize # Get HTML output html = highlight(&quot;def foo(): pass&quot;, &quot;python&quot;) # Get raw tokens tokens = tokenize(&quot;def foo(): pass&quot;, &quot;python&quot;) for token in tokens: print(f&quot;{token.type}: {token.value!r}&quot;) In This Section Code Basic Usage Using highlight() and tokenize() for syntax highlighting Cpu Parallel Processing Highlight multiple code blocks concurrently with highlight_many() List Line Highlighting Highlight specific lines and add line numbers

Basic Usage The two primary functions for syntax highlighting. highlight() Generate HTML with syntax-highlighted code. from rosettes import highlight html = highlight(&quot;def hello(): pass&quot;, &quot;python&quot;) Parameters Parameter Type Default Description code str required Source code to highlight language str required Language name or alias hl_lines set[int] None 1-based line numbers to highlight show_linenos bool False Include line numbers css_class str None Container CSS class css_class_style str &quot;semantic&quot; &quot;semantic&quot; or &quot;pygments&quot; Language Aliases Languages accept multiple aliases: # These are equivalent highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;) highlight(code, &quot;py&quot;) highlight(code, &quot;python3&quot;) # JavaScript aliases highlight(code, &quot;javascript&quot;) highlight(code, &quot;js&quot;) CSS Class Styles Semantic (default) — readable class names: html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;) # css_class_style=&quot;semantic&quot; # &lt;span class=&quot;syntax-keyword&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; # &lt;span class=&quot;syntax-function&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt; Pygments — compatible with Pygments themes: html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) # &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; # &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt; Container Class The output is wrapped in a container &lt;div&gt;: # Default: &quot;rosettes&quot; for semantic, &quot;highlight&quot; for pygments html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;) # &lt;div class=&quot;rosettes&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;... html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) # &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;... # Custom class html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, css_class=&quot;my-code&quot;) # &lt;div class=&quot;my-code&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt;... tokenize() Get raw tokens without formatting. Useful for custom output formats or analysis. from rosettes import tokenize tokens = tokenize(&quot;x = 42&quot;, &quot;python&quot;) for token in tokens: print(f&quot;{token.type.name}: {token.value!r}&quot;) Output: NAME: 'x' WHITESPACE: ' ' OPERATOR: '=' WHITESPACE: ' ' NUMBER_INTEGER: '42' Token Structure Each token is a NamedTuple with: Attribute Type Description type TokenType Semantic token type value str The actual text line int 1-based line number column int 1-based column number token = tokens[0] print(token.type) # TokenType.NAME print(token.value) # &#x27;x&#x27; print(token.line) # 1 print(token.column) # 1 Use Cases Custom formatters: Build terminal, LaTeX, or other output formats Analysis: Count tokens, find patterns, compute metrics Testing: Verify lexer behavior Transformations: Modify code based on token structure Error Handling Both functions raise LookupError for unsupported languages: from rosettes import highlight, supports_language # Check before highlighting if supports_language(&quot;python&quot;): html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;) # Or handle the exception try: html = highlight(code, &quot;unknown&quot;) except LookupError as e: print(f&quot;Unsupported language: {e}&quot;) Next Steps Parallel Processing — highlight_many() for multiple blocks Line Highlighting — Highlight specific lines CSS Classes — Style your output

Section: highlighting
Tags: highlighting, lines

Line Highlighting Draw attention to specific lines or add line numbers to code blocks. Highlight Specific Lines Use hl_lines to highlight specific lines: from rosettes import highlight code = &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;def greet(name): message = f&quot;Hello, {name}!&quot; return message &#x27;&#x27;&#x27; # Highlight line 2 (1-based indexing) html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, hl_lines={2}) The highlighted line receives the .hll CSS class: &lt;div class=&quot;rosettes&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;def greet(name):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;line hll&quot;&gt; message = f&quot;Hello, {name}!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; return message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Multiple Lines Pass a set of line numbers: # Highlight lines 2 and 3 html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, hl_lines={2, 3}) # Highlight a range html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, hl_lines=set(range(2, 5))) # lines 2, 3, 4 Styling Highlighted Lines /* Subtle background highlight */ .rosettes .hll { background-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.1); display: block; } /* Or with a border */ .rosettes .hll { border-left: 3px solid #f1fa8c; padding-left: 0.5em; margin-left: -0.5em; } Line Numbers Add line numbers with show_linenos: html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, show_linenos=True) Output structure: &lt;div class=&quot;rosettes&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;def greet(name):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; message = f&quot;Hello, {name}!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; return message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Styling Line Numbers .rosettes .lineno { color: #6272a4; user-select: none; /* Don&#x27;t include in copy */ padding-right: 1em; text-align: right; min-width: 2em; display: inline-block; } Combining Options Use both together: html = highlight( code, &quot;python&quot;, show_linenos=True, hl_lines={2, 3}, ) Performance Note Line highlighting and line numbers use the &quot;slow path&quot; internally, which processes tokens line-by-line. For maximum performance without these features, the &quot;fast path&quot; streams tokens directly. Mode Use Case Relative Speed Fast path No line features 1.0x Slow path hl_lines or show_linenos ~0.85x The difference is negligible for most use cases.

## Page 17/141: Parallel Processing

URL: /docs/highlighting/parallel/
Section: highlighting
Tags: parallel, performance

Parallel Processing For sites with many code blocks, highlight_many() provides concurrent processing with 1.5-2x speedup on Python 3.14t. When to Use Scenario Recommendation &lt; 8 blocks Use highlight() in a loop 8+ blocks Use highlight_many() 50+ blocks on 3.14t Significant speedup The overhead of thread management makes highlight_many() slower for small batches. Rosettes automatically falls back to sequential processing for &lt; 8 blocks. highlight_many() Highlight multiple code blocks in parallel. from rosettes import highlight_many blocks = [ (&quot;def foo(): pass&quot;, &quot;python&quot;), (&quot;const x = 1;&quot;, &quot;javascript&quot;), (&quot;fn main() {}&quot;, &quot;rust&quot;), (&#x27;{&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;}&#x27;, &quot;json&quot;), ] results = highlight_many(blocks) # Returns list of HTML strings in same order as input Parameters Parameter Type Default Description items Iterable[tuple[str, str]] required (code, language) tuples max_workers int min(4, cpu_count) Thread count css_class_style str &quot;semantic&quot; &quot;semantic&quot; or &quot;pygments&quot; Worker Count The default of 4 workers is optimal based on benchmarking: # Default: 4 workers (optimal) results = highlight_many(blocks) # Custom worker count results = highlight_many(blocks, max_workers=8) Note Note More workers doesn't always mean faster. Thread overhead and memory contention can reduce performance beyond 4-8 workers. tokenize_many() Parallel tokenization for raw token access. from rosettes import tokenize_many blocks = [ (&quot;x = 1&quot;, &quot;python&quot;), (&quot;let y = 2;&quot;, &quot;javascript&quot;), ] results = tokenize_many(blocks) # Returns list of token lists for i, tokens in enumerate(results): print(f&quot;Block {i}: {len(tokens)} tokens&quot;) Free-Threading Performance On Python 3.14t with free-threading enabled (PEP 703), highlight_many() provides true parallelism: Blocks GIL Python Free-Threading Speedup 10 15ms 12ms 1.25x 50 75ms 42ms 1.78x 100 150ms 78ms 1.92x Why It Works Rosettes is thread-safe by design: Immutable tokens: Token is a NamedTuple Local-only state: Lexers use only local variables during tokenization No shared mutable data: No global state to contend for PEP 703 declaration: Module declares itself safe for free-threading Example: Static Site Generator from rosettes import highlight_many from pathlib import Path def highlight_all_code_blocks(pages: list[dict]) -&gt; list[dict]: &quot;&quot;&quot;Highlight all code blocks across all pages.&quot;&quot;&quot; # Collect all code blocks blocks = [] block_locations = [] # Track which page/block each belongs to for page_idx, page in enumerate(pages): for block_idx, block in enumerate(page[&quot;code_blocks&quot;]): blocks.append((block[&quot;code&quot;], block[&quot;language&quot;])) block_locations.append((page_idx, block_idx)) # Highlight in parallel results = highlight_many(blocks) # Assign results back to pages for (page_idx, block_idx), html in zip(block_locations, results): pages[page_idx][&quot;code_blocks&quot;][block_idx][&quot;html&quot;] = html return pages Next Steps Thread Safety — How Rosettes achieves thread safety Performance — Benchmarks and optimization tips

Tags: pygments, themes

Pygments Themes Rosettes supports Pygments-compatible CSS classes, allowing you to use any existing Pygments theme. Enable Pygments Classes from rosettes import highlight html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) This generates HTML with Pygments class names: &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;python&quot;&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;... Using a Pygments Theme Option 1: CDN Popular themes are available via CDN: &lt;!-- Monokai --&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.9.0/styles/monokai.min.css&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- Dracula --&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.9.0/styles/dracula.min.css&quot;&gt; Note Note highlight.js themes work with Pygments classes since they use the same class names. Option 2: Generate from Pygments If you have Pygments installed: pygmentize -S monokai -f html &gt; monokai.css Option 3: Copy a Theme Here's Monokai as an example: .highlight { background: #272822; } .highlight .c { color: #75715e } /* Comment */ .highlight .k { color: #66d9ef } /* Keyword */ .highlight .n { color: #f8f8f2 } /* Name */ .highlight .o { color: #f92672 } /* Operator */ .highlight .p { color: #f8f8f2 } /* Punctuation */ .highlight .s { color: #e6db74 } /* String */ .highlight .m { color: #ae81ff } /* Number */ .highlight .nf { color: #a6e22e } /* Name.Function */ .highlight .nc { color: #a6e22e } /* Name.Class */ .highlight .nd { color: #a6e22e } /* Name.Decorator */ .highlight .nb { color: #f8f8f2 } /* Name.Builtin */ Popular Themes Theme Style Background Monokai Dark #272822 Dracula Dark #282a36 One Dark Dark #282c34 Solarized Dark Dark #002b36 Solarized Light Light #fdf6e3 GitHub Light #ffffff GitHub Dark Dark #0d1117 Container Class When using Pygments style, the container class changes: # Semantic style (default) html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;) # &lt;div class=&quot;rosettes&quot;&gt; # Pygments style html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) # &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt; # Custom container html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;, css_class=&quot;codehilite&quot;) # &lt;div class=&quot;codehilite&quot;&gt; Migration from Pygments If you're switching from Pygments to Rosettes: Keep your existing CSS theme Use css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot; No CSS changes needed # Before (Pygments) from pygments import highlight as pyg_highlight from pygments.lexers import PythonLexer from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter html = pyg_highlight(code, PythonLexer(), HtmlFormatter()) # After (Rosettes) from rosettes import highlight html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) Next Steps Custom Themes — Build your own theme Migration Guide — Full migration walkthrough

Migrate from Pygments Switch from Pygments to Rosettes for faster, safer HTML syntax highlighting. Prerequisites Python 3.14+ Existing Pygments-based highlighting HTML output (Rosettes doesn't support LaTeX, RTF, etc.) Step 1: Install Rosettes pip install rosettes Step 2: Update Imports Before (Pygments): from pygments import highlight from pygments.lexers import get_lexer_by_name, PythonLexer from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter After (Rosettes): from rosettes import highlight, supports_language Step 3: Update Highlighting Calls Before (Pygments): def highlight_code(code: str, language: str) -&gt; str: try: lexer = get_lexer_by_name(language) except ClassNotFound: lexer = TextLexer() formatter = HtmlFormatter(cssclass=&quot;highlight&quot;) return highlight(code, lexer, formatter) After (Rosettes): def highlight_code(code: str, language: str) -&gt; str: if not supports_language(language): language = &quot;plaintext&quot; return highlight(code, language, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) Key differences: Single import instead of three css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot; for theme compatibility supports_language() for validation Step 4: Keep Your CSS Your existing Pygments CSS theme works unchanged: /* Your existing Pygments theme */ .highlight { background: #272822; } .highlight .k { color: #66d9ef; } .highlight .nf { color: #a6e22e; } /* ... */ Rosettes generates the same CSS classes when using css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;. Step 5: Update Line Highlighting (Optional) Before (Pygments): formatter = HtmlFormatter( linenos=True, hl_lines=[2, 3, 4], ) After (Rosettes): html = highlight( code, language, show_linenos=True, hl_lines={2, 3, 4}, # Note: set, not list css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;, ) Step 6: Update Parallel Highlighting (Optional) Before (Pygments): from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor def highlight_many_pygments(blocks): with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor: return list(executor.map( lambda b: highlight_code(b[0], b[1]), blocks )) After (Rosettes): from rosettes import highlight_many def highlight_many_rosettes(blocks): return highlight_many(blocks, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) Built-in, optimized, and thread-safe. Complete Migration Example Before: from pygments import highlight from pygments.lexers import get_lexer_by_name, TextLexer from pygments.lexers import ClassNotFound from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter class CodeHighlighter: def __init__(self): self.formatter = HtmlFormatter(cssclass=&quot;highlight&quot;) def highlight(self, code: str, language: str) -&gt; str: try: lexer = get_lexer_by_name(language) except ClassNotFound: lexer = TextLexer() return highlight(code, lexer, self.formatter) def highlight_with_lines( self, code: str, language: str, hl_lines: list[int], ) -&gt; str: try: lexer = get_lexer_by_name(language) except ClassNotFound: lexer = TextLexer() formatter = HtmlFormatter( cssclass=&quot;highlight&quot;, linenos=True, hl_lines=hl_lines, ) return highlight(code, lexer, formatter) After: from rosettes import highlight, highlight_many, supports_language class CodeHighlighter: def highlight(self, code: str, language: str) -&gt; str: if not supports_language(language): language = &quot;plaintext&quot; return highlight(code, language, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) def highlight_with_lines( self, code: str, language: str, hl_lines: set[int], ) -&gt; str: if not supports_language(language): language = &quot;plaintext&quot; return highlight( code, language, show_linenos=True, hl_lines=hl_lines, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;, ) def highlight_batch( self, blocks: list[tuple[str, str]], ) -&gt; list[str]: # Validate languages validated = [ (code, lang if supports_language(lang) else &quot;plaintext&quot;) for code, lang in blocks ] return highlight_many(validated, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) API Mapping Pygments Rosettes get_lexer_by_name(lang) get_lexer(lang) ClassNotFound exception LookupError exception supports_language() check supports_language(lang) HtmlFormatter(cssclass=...) highlight(..., css_class=...) HtmlFormatter(linenos=True) highlight(..., show_linenos=True) hl_lines=[1,2,3] hl_lines={1,2,3} (set) Known Differences Aspect Pygments Rosettes Languages 500+ 55 Output formats HTML, LaTeX, RTF, etc. HTML only hl_lines type list set or frozenset Line number format Configurable Fixed format Verification After migration, verify: Output looks the same: Compare rendered HTML CSS classes match: Inspect generated class names Performance improved: Benchmark before/after No errors: Test with all your languages # Quick verification from rosettes import highlight html = highlight(&quot;def foo(): pass&quot;, &quot;python&quot;, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) assert &#x27;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&#x27; in html assert &#x27;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&#x27; in html print(&quot;✅ Migration successful!&quot;) Next Steps Parallel Processing — Optimize batch highlighting Comparison — Full Rosettes vs Pygments comparison Pygments Themes — Theme compatibility details

A pure-Python syntax highlighter designed for free-threaded Python. All lexers are hand-written state machines with O(n) guaranteed performance and zero ReDoS vulnerability. Example: &gt;&gt;&gt; from rosettes import highlight &gt;&gt;&gt; html = highlight(&quot;def foo(): pass&quot;, &quot;python&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; print(html) &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt; Thread-Safety: All public APIs are thread-safe by design: Lexers use only local variables during tokenization Formatter state is immutable Registry uses functools.cache for thread-safe memoization Parallel Processing (3.14t): Rosettes supports parallel tokenization for maximum performance on free-threaded Python. Use highlight_many() for multiple code blocks or tokenize_parallel() for large single files. Free-Threading Declaration: This module declares itself safe for free-threaded Python via the _Py_mod_gil attribute (PEP 703).

Useful for analysis, custom formatting, or testing. Thread-safe. All lexers are hand-written state machines with O(n) guaranteed performance and zero ReDoS vulnerability. Parameters Name Type Description code str The source code to tokenize. language str Language name or alias. start int Starting index in the source string. Default: 0 end int | None Optional ending index in the source string. Default: None Returns list[Token] highlight_many 1 list[str] ▼ Highlight multiple code blocks in parallel. This is the recommended way to hig… def highlight_many(items: Iterable[tuple[str, str]]) -&gt; list[str] Highlight multiple code blocks in parallel. This is the recommended way to highlight many code blocks concurrently. On Python 3.14t (free-threaded), this provides true parallelism. On GIL Python, it still provides benefits via I/O overlapping. Thread-safe by design: each lexer uses only local variables. Performance: On 3.14t with 4+ cores, highlighting 50+ code blocks provides 1.5-2x speedup over sequential processing. Parameters Name Type Description items Iterable[tuple[str, str]] Iterable of (code, language) tuples. Returns list[str] tokenize_many 1 list[list[Token]] ▼ Tokenize multiple code blocks in parallel.

Similar to highlight_many() but returns raw tokens instead of HTML. Useful for analysis, custom formatting, or when you need token data. Thread-safe by design: each lexer uses only local variables.
