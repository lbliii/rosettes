{"url":"/docs/about/faq/","title":"FAQ","description":"Frequently asked questions about Rosettes","plain_text":"FAQ General What is Rosettes? Rosettes is a pure-Python syntax highlighter designed for Python 3.14t's free-threading era. It uses hand-written state machine lexers instead of regex, guaranteeing O(n) performance and eliminating ReDoS vulnerabilities. Why &quot;Rosettes&quot;? Rosettes are the distinctive rose-shaped spots on a Bengal cat's coat. This library was extracted from the Bengal static site generator, maintaining the feline naming theme. What Python versions are supported? Python 3.14 and later. Rosettes is designed for modern Python with free-threading support (PEP 703). Languages How many languages are supported? 55 languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Go, C, C++, Java, Ruby, PHP, and more. Why not 500+ languages like Pygments? Quality over quantity. Each Rosettes lexer is a hand-written state machine optimized for performance and correctness. Adding a language requires careful implementation, not just regex patterns. Can I request a new language? Yes! Open an issue on GitHub. Popular languages are prioritized. Does Rosettes support automatic language detection? No. Rosettes requires explicit language specification. For auto-detection, use filename extensions or a separate library like pygments.lexers.guess_lexer(). Performance How much faster is Rosettes than Pygments? 2-4x faster for typical code blocks: Operation Speedup Tokenize 3.75x Highlight 2.89x Parallel (8 blocks) 2.18x What is ReDoS and why should I care? ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) occurs when a regex pattern exhibits exponential backtracking on certain inputs. A crafted string can freeze your application for hours. Rosettes is immune to ReDoS because it doesn't use regex for lexing. When should I use highlight_many()? For 8 or more code blocks. The thread pool overhead makes it slower for small batches. Styling Can I use my existing Pygments themes? Yes! Use css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;: html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) What's the difference between semantic and Pygments classes? Style Example Class Readable Semantic .syntax-keyword ✅ Yes Pygments .k ❌ Cryptic Semantic classes are self-documenting. Pygments classes are compatible with existing themes. Integration Does Rosettes work with Sphinx? Not directly. Sphinx uses Pygments. You'd need to build a Sphinx extension to use Rosettes. Does Rosettes work with Jupyter? Not directly. Jupyter uses Pygments for syntax highlighting. Custom configuration would be needed. Does Rosettes work with Bengal? Yes! Bengal uses Rosettes for all syntax highlighting. Thread Safety Is Rosettes thread-safe? Yes. All public APIs are thread-safe: Tokens are immutable NamedTuples Lexers use only local variables Registry uses functools.cache Does Rosettes work with Python 3.14t free-threading? Yes. Rosettes declares itself safe for free-threading via _Py_mod_gil (PEP 703). The highlight_many() function provides true parallelism on 3.14t. Troubleshooting LookupError: Unknown language The language name or alias isn't recognized: from rosettes import supports_language, list_languages # Check if language is supported supports_language(&quot;python&quot;) # True supports_language(&quot;cobol&quot;) # False # List all supported languages print(list_languages()) Output looks wrong Check you're using the correct language Verify your CSS includes the appropriate classes Check for conflicting CSS rules Performance is slower than expected Use highlight_many() for multiple blocks Avoid show_linenos=True and hl_lines unless needed Profile with cProfile to identify bottlenecks Contributing How do I add a new language? Create lexers/mylang_sm.py with a state machine lexer Register in lexers/__init__.py Add tests in tests/lexers/test_mylang.py Submit a pull request How do I report a bug? Open an issue on GitHub with: Python version Rosettes version Minimal reproducing code Expected vs actual output","excerpt":"FAQ General What is Rosettes?
