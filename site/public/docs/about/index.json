Every design decision prioritizes safety, predictability, and performance. Core Principles Principle Meaning O(n) guaranteed Linear time complexity, no exponential blowup Zero ReDoS No regex patterns that can be exploited Thread-safe by design Immutable state, no global mutable data Pygments compatible Drop-in CSS class compatibility Why Rosettes? Traditional syntax highlighters use regular expressions, which can exhibit exponential worst-case behavior (ReDoS). A carefully crafted input can freeze your application for minutes or hours. Rosettes eliminates this risk entirely by using hand-written state machine lexers. Every lexer processes input character-by-character with single-character lookahead, guaranteeing O(n) time complexity.
