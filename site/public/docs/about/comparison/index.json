Summary Aspect Rosettes Pygments Languages 55 500+ Performance 2-4x faster Baseline ReDoS safe ✅ Yes ❌ Some lexers vulnerable Free-threading ✅ Optimized ❌ Not tested Dependencies None None Maturity New (2024) Established (2006) When to Choose Rosettes ✅ Choose Rosettes when: You need guaranteed O(n) performance Security is critical (no ReDoS risk) You're using Python 3.14t with free-threading You're highlighting common languages (Python, JS, Rust, etc.) You want parallel highlighting for many code blocks ❌ Choose Pygments when: You need obscure language support (500+ languages) You need output formats beyond HTML (LaTeX, RTF, terminal) You're on Python &lt; 3.14 You need battle-tested stability Feature Comparison Language Support Category Rosettes Pygments Total languages 55 500+ Popular languages ✅ Full coverage ✅ Full coverage Obscure languages ❌ Limited ✅ Extensive Quality Hand-written, optimized Variable Rosettes covers: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Go, C, C++, Java, Ruby, PHP, and 45 more popular languages. Pygments adds: COBOL, Fortran, Ada, dozens of DSLs, legacy languages, and specialized formats. Output Formats Format Rosettes Pygments HTML ✅ ✅ Terminal/ANSI ❌ ✅ LaTeX ❌ ✅ RTF ❌ ✅ SVG ❌ ✅ IRC ❌ ✅ Rosettes focuses on HTML output. For other formats, use Pygments or build a custom formatter. CSS Compatibility Style Rosettes Pygments Pygments classes ✅ css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot; ✅ Native Semantic classes ✅ css_class_style=&quot;semantic&quot; ❌ N/A Theme compatibility ✅ Full ✅ Native Rosettes can use any Pygments CSS theme with css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;. Performance Comparison Single Block Highlighting File Size Rosettes Pygments Speedup 100 lines 0.5ms 1.5ms 3x 1,000 lines 2ms 8ms 4x 10,000 lines 18ms 52ms 2.9x Parallel Highlighting (8 blocks) Scenario Rosettes Pygments Speedup GIL Python 22ms 48ms 2.2x Free-threading 12ms N/A N/A Pygments doesn't have built-in parallel support, requiring manual thread pool setup. Security Comparison ReDoS Vulnerability Rosettes: Not vulnerable. State machine lexers process each character exactly once. Pygments: Some lexers are vulnerable. Crafted input can cause exponential processing time. Example vulnerable pattern (simplified): # Pygments regex pattern (hypothetical) r&#x27;(a+)+$&#x27; # Malicious input &quot;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&quot; # Result: Exponential backtracking Rosettes eliminates this entire category of vulnerability by design. API Comparison Basic Highlighting Rosettes: from rosettes import highlight html = highlight(&quot;def foo(): pass&quot;, &quot;python&quot;) Pygments: from pygments import highlight from pygments.lexers import PythonLexer from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter html = highlight(&quot;def foo(): pass&quot;, PythonLexer(), HtmlFormatter()) Tokenization Rosettes: from rosettes import tokenize tokens = tokenize(&quot;x = 1&quot;, &quot;python&quot;) Pygments: from pygments.lexers import PythonLexer tokens = list(PythonLexer().get_tokens(&quot;x = 1&quot;)) Parallel Highlighting Rosettes: from rosettes import highlight_many results = highlight_many(blocks) # Built-in Pygments: from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor from pygments import highlight # ... manual setup required Migration Path Switching from Pygments to Rosettes is straightforward for HTML output: # Before (Pygments) from pygments import highlight from pygments.lexers import get_lexer_by_name from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter lexer = get_lexer_by_name(&quot;python&quot;) formatter = HtmlFormatter() html = highlight(code, lexer, formatter) # After (Rosettes) from rosettes import highlight html = highlight(code, &quot;python&quot;, css_class_style=&quot;pygments&quot;) Your existing CSS themes work without changes.

For specialized needs (obscure languages, non-HTML output), Pygments remains the comprehensive choice.","excerpt":"Rosettes vs Pygments A detailed comparison of Rosettes and Pygments for syntax highlighting.
